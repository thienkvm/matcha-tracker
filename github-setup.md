# GitHub Setup Instructions

After creating your repository on GitHub, run these commands in the `/workspace/final` directory:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as the remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push the code to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with the repository name you created.

## Alternative: Using SSH (if you have SSH keys set up)

```bash
# Add SSH remote
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push the code
git push -u origin main
```

## What's Already Done

✅ Git repository initialized
✅ All files added and committed
✅ Branch renamed to 'main'
✅ Ready to push to GitHub

## Repository Contents

- `index.html` - Main application file
- `styles.css` - Complete styling and responsive design
- `script.js` - Full application functionality
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps After Pushing

1. Enable GitHub Pages (if you want to host it live):
   - Go to repository Settings → Pages
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
   - Your app will be live at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO_NAME`

2. Share the repository URL with others
3. Continue developing new features if desired
